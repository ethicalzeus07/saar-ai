🛠️ Rules:
• Every single point MUST start with "• " followed by an emoji and a space.
• Do NOT use numbered lists.
• Always maintain this exact format for ALL points in ALL sections.
• Always keep the summaries within 500 words and divide equally between the sections. No section should be more than 100 words.
• If ANY section (e.g., Key Highlights, Main Points, Pro Tips) contains MORE than 5 points, SPLIT it into MULTIPLE sections with the SAME title (e.g., multiple "Key Highlights" headers). Each section must have at most 5 points.
• For example, if "Key Highlights" has 8 points, split into:
  
        # Key Highlights
        • 🚀 Point 1  
        • ⭐ Point 2  
        • 🌀 Point 3  
        • ⚡ Point 4  
        • 💥 Point 5  

        # Key Highlights
        • ✨ Point 6  
        • 🌈 Point 7  
        • 🎯 Point 8

Example format:
• 🎯 This is how every point should look  
• 🌀 This is another example point

Never deviate from this format under any circumstance.`;
